# KnaveUI
Hello friednds and welcome to KnaveUI!

This project was born out of a desire to make character sheet management for Knave easier for my friends. I finished the coding for this version in about a week, but now I am seeking to add features and fix bugs. Please feel free to usethe program and let me know what you would like to see!

It is still early, I am quite aware it is not optimized.
